# Rosenkrans

## Goal
I am building a website that is a complete guide for how to pray the catholic rosary. I want it to be a beautilful and simple but complete website that one can use to learn or pray the rosary. 

## Target Users
Mobile and desktop. 

## Language
The website content should be in the norwegian language. The content the main page is based on will be in rosenkransen.md in Norwegian.

## Initial website content
The inital texts will be in rosenkransen.md, it should not be converted to html and displayed as it is, but use as a source and inspiration for the generated content on the main page.

## Core Features (MVP)
1. It should be interactive (accordion collapsable text that can be toggled in several configurations) to only show the elements needed for each user.
2. Vanilla sveltekit site
3. An interactive dynamic design element for the desktop site: A minimal monochrome mary statue softly rotating around its y axis like the globe when scrolling up and down. Other decorations: thinline minimal gothic crosses around the statue also dynamic.

## Tech Stack
Sveltekit + svelte
git: github repo already connected
Deployment: vercel

## Style and aesthetic
- Pure and , catholic religious
- Minimal but with neogothic inspiration
- Coloruful, use color palette of pastel colors not white
- Serif style fonts that match the minimal neogothic aesthetic, font-color: black

## Engineering Standards
- Sveltescript with javascript(not typescript)
- Vanilla sveltekit, only ask for permission to use plugin if needed.
- Elegant readable code with comments
- Made to be tweaked and styled easily by human developers afterward
- Global and scoped styling the svelte way
- Mobile first approach.
