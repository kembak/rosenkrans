# DEV LOG

- Initialized a vanilla JavaScript SvelteKit project in this folder (minimal template, no TypeScript).
- Added core project files from scaffold: `src/`, `static/`, `package.json`, `svelte.config.js`, `vite.config.js`, `jsconfig.json`, `.npmrc`.
- Switched deployment adapter from auto to Vercel in `svelte.config.js`.
- Set explicit Vercel runtime to `nodejs22.x` for environment compatibility.
- Kept `+layout.js` prerender enabled to avoid local Windows symlink issues during Vercel output generation.
- Updated npm scripts and dependency versions to a compatible set for local Node environment and Vercel build.
- Added/updated `.gitignore` for SvelteKit/Vercel/Node output and local artifacts.
- Replaced default placeholder page with a full content-driven main page structure.
- Built a parser/data layer in `src/lib/content/rosaryContent.js` that reads `rosenkransen.md` and generates structured content instead of rendering raw markdown.
- Added reusable UI components:
- `src/lib/components/Accordion.svelte`
- `src/lib/components/ToggleGroup.svelte`
- `src/lib/components/StatueVisual.svelte` (initially added, later removed from page usage per revised requirements).
- Added global stylesheet `src/app.css` and wired it via `+layout.svelte`.
- Added page metadata and language configuration for Norwegian content.
- Created mobile-first section layout for `Rekkefølge`, `Bønner`, and `Mysterier` with toggle controls.
- Fixed missing content parsing issues so first blocks (for example `Introduksjon` and `Gledens mysterier`) are included correctly.
- Fixed accordion interaction issues and open-state handling.
- Updated section visibility behavior so all sections can be hidden if all toggle buttons are deselected.
- Removed compact-mode checkbox and related logic when requested.
- Changed default open behavior:
- `Rekkefølge`: all steps initially open.
- `Bønner`: all prayers initially open.
- `Mysterier`: kept default behavior.
- Reworked header to include traditional title/subheader plus right-side image (`virginmary2.png`).
- Added rosary illustration (`rosaryillustration-2.png`) in the `Rekkefølge` section and later moved it to the right with larger sizing.
- Removed decorative scrolling Mary/cross visual element from active page layout based on updated brief.
- Iterated visual theme from bordered cards to flat/unbordered minimalist sections.
- Updated color direction to light pastel green base with lavender and pastel sky-blue accents.
- Simplified background from gradient to flat pastel green.
- Added section heading underlines for section separation instead of boxed borders.
- Reduced main content width multiple times (latest: approximately 20% narrower from prior width).
- Updated typography split:
- Headings/subheading forced to Baskerville-style (`Baskerville Old Face` fallback stack).
- Body text set to `Lora` with Google Fonts import for consistency.
- Refined accordion trigger styling:
- Unbordered transparent button style.
- Title text rendered as underlined `h3`.
- Replaced text `+/-` indicators with anchored SVG chevron icon.
- Added quick/smooth accordion animations (icon rotation + content slide transition).
- Simplified toggle-group buttons:
- Removed hover motion transform.
- Removed subtitle (`<small>`) text.
- Updated README with local setup, build steps, Vercel deployment notes, and edit points for content/design.
- Repeatedly validated with `npm run build` after each major iteration to ensure deploy-ready output.
